// Design and implement a Point class which models points in the Cartesian coordinate system (done in class already).

// Design and implement a Segment class using the idea that 2 points determine a line segment.

// Be sure to include the following methods:
// 1. At least one constructor with defaults.
// 2. Accessor, Get and Set methods.
// 3. Appropriate useful utility methods (print and length at the very minimum).

// 4. In the main, construct a vector of 50 Segments with random points in Quadrant 1 (QI) ranging from 0 to 1 on the x-axis and 0 to 1 on the y-axis. 

// Write a main driver program (no user input) that demonstrates the usage of your class designs.
